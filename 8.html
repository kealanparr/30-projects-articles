		<header class="header">8. Launch developer-forge</header>

		<p>I have a few websites at the minute. I think the total count is around 10. One of them was my personal
			blogging site. It was written in Next.js, called <a href="https://developer-forge.com/">developer-forge</a>
		</p>

		<p>I had become increasingly frustrated with it though, and as a side effect was barely blogging on it</p>

		<p>I really enjoy technical writing, so it was annoying that I just couldn't muster up the effort to tear
			it down and start again</p>

		<p>What was bad about it? What were the problems?</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				It had really poor image insertion ability
			</li>
			<li>
				I wanted to add search onto the site (which was a pretty big change)
			</li>
			<li>
				I wanted to be able to categorise my posts, for example: 30-projects articles, code snippets or
				external-posts. This would allow me to filter down my posts much easier
			</li>
			<li>
				I didn't want a CMS. I wanted to just edit bare files in my codebase
			</li>
			<li>
				I wanted to completely re-design my breadcrumb
			</li>
			<li>
				I wanted to use stable technology. I've been on the bleeding edge before, and the constant head-ache
				of updating things was more pain than gain
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>This was alongside some more small pieces I wanted to ensure also (posts must be written in Markdown <i>etc</i> <i>etc</i>)
		</p>

		<p>This then led me to spending a few months playing with a few different technologies to try and find the best,
			simplest fit</p>

		<p>I knew exactly which choices were wrong! But knowing which one was right was a little trickier</p>

		<p>I ended up playing with a whole host of new technologies. I played with Ruby, Jekyll, Svelete and a few more
		</p>

		<p>Mostly static site renderers, because that's my preference for a blend between simplicity and speed</p>

		<p>I played around with Algolia quite a lot too, to understand how search generally works in software
			applications. I got a very basic proof of concept running wired into Algolia</p>

		<p>I eventually found Vue to be the best fit for what I wanted to do, and there was a really great starter
			template created by <a href="https://twitter.com/meteorlxy_cn">meteorxly</a></p>

		<p>So please go and visit the shiny new <a href="https://developer-forge.com/">developer-forge</a> üòâ</p>

		<p>This project ended up taking around a year which was much, much longer than I expected. But I also moved between a few different tech choices before I finally settled and "doubled down" on what I think was the right choice</p>

		<p>I had to move around 80 articles into this new platform, so I wanted to make sure whatever I chose wouldn't need to be constantly migrated. I know developers get a bad-rap for constantly moving to the newest shiny tool, but I really didn't fancy the admin of moving the 80 or so articles I've wrote more than once, so this was more of a "measure-twice and cut-once" project</p>

		<p>During this time also, Elon bought Twitter and killed Revue which was my email-newsletter provider which meant I had to migrate all my 30-projects subscribers from one platform to another (thanks Elon! üò°üòâ)</p>

		<p>But it's done now! And I'm so proud with it, I've already wrote 3 new articles on there and shipped my next 30-projects!</p>

		<p>Onto project nine ‚úîÔ∏è</p>
