		<header class="header">Create an array cheatsheet</header>

		<p>I've always wanted to make a cheatsheet for something, but felt like my design skills were too weak (to make it look good)</p>

		<p>I found myself doing a lot of work on arrays in JavaScript for a particular project - and repeatedly googling a lot of the functions to acheieve what I needed to do</p>

		<p>I thought this would be a good excuse to make my first cheat sheet! </p>

		<p>I don't think it looks great as it's my first one - but I enjoyed the process of creating it</p>

		<p>This project took much longer than expected, and I think I might come back to this in the future to update and improve it, but I have quite a few things going on right now - and other work I wanted to focus on more heavily</p>

		<p>I have already done something kind of similar to this project where I <a href="https://github.com/kealanparr/Every-link-I-wish-I-had-as-a-beginner/blob/master/readme.md">link every high quality link that has been useful to me</a> and I enjoy creating listicles of data to be useful to me (or others) later</p>

		<p>Second project ticked off ✔️</p>
