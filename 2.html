		<header class="header">2. Create an array cheat sheet</header>

		<p>I've always wanted to make a cheat sheet for something, but felt like my design skills were too weak (to make it look good)</p>

		<p>I found myself doing a lot of work on arrays in JavaScript for a particular project - and repeatedly googling a lot of the functions to achieve what I needed to do</p>

		<p>I thought this would be a good excuse to make my first cheat sheet! </p>

		<p>I enjoyed the process of creating it- and think I could improve it (after now finishing my first one!)</p>

		<p>This project took much longer than expected, and I think I might come back to this in the future to update and improve it, but I have quite a few things going on right now - and other work I wanted to focus on more heavily</p>

		<p>I have already done something kind of similar to this project where I <a href="https://github.com/kealanparr/Every-link-I-wish-I-had-as-a-beginner/blob/master/readme.md">link every high quality link that has been useful to me</a> and I enjoy creating listicles of data to be useful to me (or others) later</p>

		<p>To complete this was mostly just research on multiple JS doc sites, cross referencing to make sure I hadn't missed anything that was high-value/regularly used and then generating code snippets for the examples!</p>

		<p>All of the links in the cheat sheet are clickable - so you can deep link straight to reading more in the MDN docs</p>

		<p>Second project ticked off ✔️</p>
