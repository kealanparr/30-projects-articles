		<p>
			At the time of writing, Revue was still alive. It has since been killed dead when Elon bought Twitter. My email list is now hosted on <a href="https://buttondown.email/kealanparr/">button-down</a>, but I thought it might be worthwhile just adding an edit, and leaving the article as is.
		</p>

		<p>
			All the places that consume my email-subscription api-keys (for example, the email subscribe box on 30-project.com all now use buttondown)
		</p>

		<header class="header">5. Create an email newsletter</header>

		<p>I have been sharing my progress on 30 projects publicly - and when I shared it with a friend in America he stated
			"If there was an email signup for 30-projects to receive updates via email I would totally put my email in there!"
		</p>

		<p>That got me thinking it was a good idea 🤔 and would also be a good opportunity to learn more about email
			newsletter and marketing - and so the next project became how I could most easily create an email newsletter for
			30 projects</p>

		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/kealan">Revue</a> seemed like an awesome solution to do
			this (after Googling some competitors) - and after I set it up with all of my details, I only had two more steps
			to complete the project</p>

		<ol>
			<li>I needed to retrieve an API key from Revue to include it on the <a
					href="https://30-projects.com/">30-projects</a> site. To integrate with different platforms, you have to
				request access - as it just isn't given out to all users. I listed a few of my publicly accessible URL's of
				writing I'd done, and my personal site and it was granted!</li>
			<li>I wanted to also protect the email sign up link from spam or abuse with reCAPTCHA. The type of protection used
				is "invisible" - so that only suspicious traffic is forced to complete the challenge</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Going forwards I do plan on sharing each new project with the email list if that is something that interests you,
			then you can sign up on <a href="https://30-projects.com/">30-projects</a> or directly on <a target="_blank"
				href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/kealan">Revue</a></p>

		<p>This project was more wiring things up than coding - but it was still fun, and I enjoyed integrating everything
			together!</p>

		<p>Onto project six ✔️</p>
