		<header class="header">6. Create an automated web-pinger</header>

		<p>I was speaking to a friend recently who is a developer - and I was looking at some of the things he had built</p>

		<p>He had hosted a few websites publicly, but almost zero worked</p>

		<p>There were links that took me to nowhere, some pages errored on load and some were dead links that must have
			changed url path that he hadn't updated</p>

		<p>It's easy to forget things, and this wasn't the end of the world, but it made me self-consciously check all my
			own websites. I was 50% sure I had checked everything thoroughly enough. But I was racking my brain to try and
			think of any obscure link, program or site that I'd hosted that I might need to check</p>

		<p>This gave me the idea for project 6, I'd make a program that would automatically check my website on some
			schedule (maybe daily?) and ensure they weren't erroring</p>

		<p>I could then make a bot to email myself if there were any issues - and viola! I'd ensure all my sites I hosted
			were in a good state, and for each new project - I'd just need to add the new url to my text file for the new
			website-pinger</p>

		<p>Sounded simple enough, so I started!</p>

		<h1>Creating the Bot email</h1>

		<p>Firstly, I made myself a Gmail that would send my bot email, I decided upon something like</p>

		<ul>
			<li>bot@gmail.com</li>
		</ul>

		<p>I now needed to allow alternative access to this account, so my Node dependencies could access the account</p>

		<p>This is pretty straightforward to do, and you just need to add a new "App Password" to your account - which is
			handy, as it doesn't compromise your "real" password- as you just get a randomly generated password from Google,
			and you can label what App has this password so you can remember</p>

		<h1>Create the program</h1>

		<p>My base functionality was an Axios GET request to a url. I decided to store all the url's in a Markdown file, and
			then I'd just need to read through the file line by line, making a GET request to each url in the list</p>

		<p>I used some GitHub secrets for the password, and email addresses - as there are a lot of bots who scrape GitHub
			repos to try and sell emails & allowed me to protect my passwords too</p>

		<p>I then need to create an email body, that I will send myself the status update</p>

		<p>You can view the code here <a href="https://github.com/kealanparr/website-pinger/blob/main/index.js">here</a></p>

		<p>I got this all working locally, and then moved onto deploying it!</p>

		<h1>Deploy</h1>

		<p>I have deployed two different things onto GitHub actions and both times have never been painless</p>

		<p>Environment variables that aren't accessible, the Action failing to run and silent YAML parsing failures were
			common "gotchas" I've encountered when deploying both times</p>

		<p>GitHub Actions feedback loops are a little frustrating to debug - but despite the setbacks, I got it deployed and
			working, and my email looks like this</p>

		<img alt="An email body that shows 3 headers, one of working URL's, one of broken URL's and one of URL's that errored in Kealan's code" src='assets/6/email-body.JPG'>

		<h1>Final steps</h1>

		<p>I wanted to tidy up my Git history as I made debug commits to try and get the GitHub action to work</p>

		<p>It ended up being pretty simple to do as I created a new branch, committed everything to the temp-branch, deleted
			main and finally renamed my branch to main and force pushed</p>

		<pre>
			<code class="javascript-html">
git checkout --orphan tmp-main # create a temp branch
git add -A  # Add all files and commit them
git commit -m 'Add files'
git branch -D main # Deletes the main branch
git branch -m main # Rename the current branch to main
git push -f origin main
			</code>
		</pre>

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>

		<p>All in all, a pretty fun project - and I gained a bit more exposure to NodeMailer which I hadn't used before</p>

		<p>I have some "flows" and steps I try and follow when I release new work publicly, so I have also updated my steps
			to ensure I add each new url to the website pinger</p>

		<p>If you're reading this in the future (18th Sept 2022) I may change the frequency of the emails if it's overkill
			to mail daily but the program is cron based, so it's only a one line change!</p>

		<p>Hope this was interesting to you + feel free to clone and add your own url's if you have a similar use-case</p>

		<p>Onto project seven ‚úîÔ∏è</p>

		<h1 style="color: #6495ED; padding-top: 30px;">Edit (Sept 22, 2022)</h1>

		<p>The pinger has been live for a few days now, so I just wanted to post a very brief update</p>

		<p>I have added loads of new paths, urls, commonly visited posts and so far am delighted with the results</p>

		<p>Every single link is returning 200's - and it's checking about 25 url's! üòä</p>

		<p>This is such a useful, and quick way for me to get a good overview of all my websites/paths!</p>

		<h1 style="color: #6495ED; padding-top: 30px;">Edit 2 (July 22, 2024)</h1>

		<p>I still have this Node script running daily! It's been running for approx 2 years, daily - for free!</p>

		<p>There have been a few times it has caught things for me, but today - as Google domains sold their domains to Squarespace (for some reason) - my nameservers started to fail</p>

		<p>I checked the email (like I do everyday, or couple of days) - corrected the nameservers and boom! Website pinger is still delivering value to future Kealan even now ;)</p>
