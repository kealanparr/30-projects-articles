		<p>I have wrote quite a lot about what is the most impactful way to "level" up your career</p>

		<p>If you want to read about those articles, I've wrote:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-become-a-better-developer/">How to Become a Better Developer – Tips to Grow Your Coding Skills</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-better-at-programming-even-when-its-hard/">Programming is Really Hard – But Don't Give Up</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://developer-forge.com/posts/just-build/">Just Build</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://developer-forge.com/posts/matrices/">How do companies measure engineers competencies?</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>The "long-story-short" of the above articles is generally to build more, code more, write more - and just repeatedly do your craft. Launch more websites, create more applications and deploy them for feedback. This is commonly referenced in popular culture in the <a href="https://excellentjourney.net/2015/03/04/art-fear-the-ceramics-class-and-quantity-before-quality/">Pottery Story</a></p>

		<p>There are so many libraries, languages and ideas that I want to create something with. At the moment, I have a .txt document with around 50 project ideas - and barely any time to create these things. I'm hoping by trimming these ideas down to 30 fun ideas it will help me to ship some fun products (and learn a lot in the process)</p>

		<p>Hopefully in the process of completing these 30, I will code things faster, expose myself to new ideas/people and build it in public on Twitter to share my successes</p>

		<p>If you don't really know me - you can learn more about me on my site Developer-Forge <a href="https://developer-forge.com/about/">here</a></p>

		<p>There are a few people/ideas who have inspired me for the idea for 30 projects, so to pay homage:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1461650348842569735">Dan Abramov answers "[how] to be a good frontend/react developer?"</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com/">Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlYBpQS8QgU">Becoming SWE: Does working outside work help?</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Going forwards, the articles will explain the reason for the project, the difficulties and process of building the project more - but the first article is more of an introduction to what 30 Projects is, who I am and the explanation for why I'm doing it</p>

		<p>Hope you find this journey interesting - and can take some inspiration to build something you find interesting!</p>
