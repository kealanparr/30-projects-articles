		<header class="header">9. Write 150 articles</header>

		<p>The whole point of starting 30-projects was to expand and develop my shipping skills</p>

		<p>The tag line for the whole thing was: <i>Building 30 Projects to improve my ability to code, build and ship.</i></p>
		
		<p>In essence, learning by doing</p>
		
		<p>And in the spirit of this, the biggest jump in my skills has probably come about as a result of writing technical articles online, to share and develop my expertise</p>

		<p>I have always loved writing, so I've been lucky that my two interests have crossed over, and been useful for me to learn more and have fun too</p>

		<p>I initially started writing to give back to the open source community, who were so influential from me going to a Biology graduate with zero skills, to a Senior Software engineer working profesionally</p>

		<p>I recently wrote 3 new freeCodeCamp articles and decided to tot up how many articled I'd written</p>

		<p>From paid articles written under my Kealan Parr Limited company, ghost written articles and articles written on 3rd party websites, I have published my 150th article this week!</p>

		<p>I haven't actually counted the current 30-projects artciles I've written, so I'm actually around 160</p>

		<p>But 150 is a nice round number, & my marketing team (lol) told me that it would sound better üòâ</p>

		<p>If you want to read all 150, you can find all the platforms I'm published on, <a href="https://kealanparr.com/writings">here</a></p>

		<p>Onto project ten ‚úîÔ∏è</p>
